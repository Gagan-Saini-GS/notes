### **1. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** is a graphical representation of how data moves through a system. It focuses on the flow of information rather than on the system‚Äôs logic.

#### **DFD Components**

1. **External Entities (Sources/Sinks)**

   - Represent users, systems, or organizations that interact with the system.
   - Example: "Customer," "Bank," or "Supplier."

2. **Processes**

   - Represent operations that transform input data into output data.
   - Example: "Process Order," "Generate Report."

3. **Data Stores**

   - Represent storage locations where data is held.
   - Example: "Customer Database," "Order Records."

4. **Data Flows**
   - Represent the movement of data between entities, processes, and data stores.
   - Example: "Customer sends order details."

#### **DFD Levels**

- **Level 0 (Context Diagram)** ‚Üí The highest level, showing the system as a single process interacting with external entities.
- **Level 1** ‚Üí Expands the main process into multiple sub-processes.
- **Level 2 and beyond** ‚Üí Further breakdown of sub-processes for detailed analysis.

‚úÖ **Advantages:**

- Provides a clear visual understanding of system processes.
- Helps identify redundancies and inefficiencies.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**

üîπ **Example:**  
A DFD for an online shopping system would show processes like **"Customer Places Order,"** data stores like **"Order Database,"** and external entities like **"Customer"** and **"Bank."**

### **2. Data Dictionary**

A **Data Dictionary** is a collection of descriptions of data elements in a system. It helps standardize definitions, making communication clear between developers, designers, and stakeholders.

#### **Data Dictionary Elements**

1. **Data Element Name** ‚Üí The name of the data field. _(Example: Customer_ID)_
2. **Data Type** ‚Üí The type of data (Integer, String, Date, etc.). _(Example: Integer)_
3. **Size** ‚Üí The maximum length of the data. _(Example: 10 characters)_
4. **Description** ‚Üí The meaning or purpose of the data element. _(Example: Unique ID for each customer)_
5. **Valid Values** ‚Üí Allowed values or range. _(Example: 1000-9999)_
6. **Relationships** ‚Üí Dependencies between data elements. _(Example: "Customer_ID" is related to "Order_ID")_

‚úÖ **Advantages:**

- Improves data consistency and communication among teams.
- Helps in database design and system documentation.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**

- Needs continuous updating as the system evolves.
