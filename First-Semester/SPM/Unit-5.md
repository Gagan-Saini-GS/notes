### **1. Staffing Level Estimation**

Staffing level estimation ensures that the right number of personnel is allocated at different project stages.

#### **Techniques for Staffing Estimation:**

1. **Putnam-Norden-Rayleigh Curve** â€“ Describes how staffing levels vary over time.
2. **COCOMO Model (Constructive Cost Model)** â€“ Uses software size (in KLOC) to estimate effort.
3. **Expert Judgment** â€“ Based on past projects and experience.

ðŸ“Œ **Example Formula (Putnam Model):**  
`Effort (E) = ((K X Size)^3/2) / (T^4)`

where:

- **Effort (E)** = person-months
- **Size** = estimated software size (KLOC)
- **T** = project duration in months
- **K** = productivity factor

### **2. Effect of Schedule Change on Cost**

- Reducing the schedule **increases cost** due to overtime, increased resource allocation, and inefficiencies.
- Extending the schedule **may reduce productivity** and increase overhead costs.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**

- A project originally estimated at **6 months** with a cost of **$500,000** is compressed to **4 months**.
- The cost may increase due to **additional hiring, training, or overtime pay** to meet deadlines.
- The new cost could rise to **$650,000-$700,000**, depending on factors like resource availability.

**Brookâ€™s Law:**  
_"Adding more people to a late project makes it later."_ â€“ More people require training, increasing communication overhead.

### **3. Project Schedule**

5. **Crashing** â€“ Adding extra resources to speed up critical tasks.

### **5. Critical Path Method (CPM) â€“ Numerical Example**

The **Critical Path Method (CPM)** is used to determine the **longest** path through a project, which defines the shortest possible completion time.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**
Consider a software project with the following tasks and dependencies:

| Task | Duration (Days) | Dependencies |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------ |
| A    | 4               | -            |
| B    | 5               | A            |
| C    | 6               | A            |
| D    | 3               | B            |
| E    | 2               | B, C         |
| F    | 4               | D            |
| G    | 3               | E, F         |

#### **Step 1: Identify Paths**

- **Path 1:** A â†’ B â†’ D â†’ F â†’ G = **4 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 19 days**
- **Path 2:** A â†’ B â†’ E â†’ G = **4 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 14 days**
- **Path 3:** A â†’ C â†’ E â†’ G = **4 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 15 days**

#### **Step 2: Find Critical Path**

- The longest path is **A â†’ B â†’ D â†’ F â†’ G** (19 days).
- This is the **Critical Path**, meaning the project cannot be completed in less than **19 days**.

#### **Step 3: Slack Calculation**

- Slack (or float) is the time a task can be delayed without delaying the project.
- **Tasks on the Critical Path have zero slack**.

### **Conclusion**

- Staffing estimation ensures adequate resource allocation.
- Schedule changes affect costs significantly.
- Project scheduling tools like Gantt Charts, PERT, and CPM are essential.
- Schedule control keeps projects on track through monitoring and adjustments.
