## **Networking Fundamentals**

### **Introduction to Networking**

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, data, and services. It enables communication between devices, whether they are in the same location (LAN ‚Äì Local Area Network) or across the globe (WAN ‚Äì Wide Area Network).

#### **Key Components of a Network:**

1. **Nodes** ‚Äì Devices such as computers, servers, and routers.
2. **Links** ‚Äì Physical (cables, fiber optics) or wireless connections.
3. **Protocols** ‚Äì Rules that govern data communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).
4. **Network Topology** ‚Äì The arrangement of devices (e.g., star, bus, mesh).
5. **IP Addressing** ‚Äì Unique identifiers for devices on a network.

### **Data & Information in Networking**

**1. Data**

- Raw, unprocessed facts and figures.
- Represented in binary (0s and 1s) for transmission over networks.

**2. Information**

- Processed and meaningful data.
- Transmitted using various protocols (HTTP for web pages, SMTP for email).

#### **Data Transmission Types:**

- **Analog & Digital** ‚Äì Analog signals are continuous, while digital signals are discrete (binary).
- **Simplex, Half-duplex, and Full-duplex** ‚Äì Defines how data flows (one-way, alternating, or simultaneous).
- **Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast** ‚Äì Determines how data is sent to one, multiple, or all devices.

## **Data Communication**

Data communication refers to the exchange of data between devices using a transmission medium. It involves sending, receiving, and processing data to ensure successful communication between computers and other network devices.

### **Characteristics of Data Communication**

To ensure effective data communication, the following characteristics must be met:

1. **Delivery** ‚Äì Data must reach the correct destination.
2. **Accuracy** ‚Äì Data should be transmitted without errors or corruption.
3. **Timeliness** ‚Äì Data should arrive in a timely manner to be useful (important for real-time communication like video calls).
4. **Jitter** ‚Äì Variation in packet arrival time should be minimal to maintain data flow consistency.

### **Components of Data Communication**

Data communication consists of five essential components:

1. **Sender (Source)** ‚Äì The device that originates the message (e.g., a computer, mobile phone).
2. **Receiver (Destination)** ‚Äì The device that receives and interprets the message (e.g., a server, another computer).
3. **Message** ‚Äì The actual data being transmitted (e.g., text, images, audio, video).
4. **Transmission Medium** ‚Äì The physical or wireless channel used to transfer data (e.g., cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi).
5. **Protocol** ‚Äì The set of rules that govern communication between sender and receiver (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).

### **Data Representation in Networking**

Data representation refers to the format in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted over a network. Since computers use binary (0s and 1s) for communication, different types of data must be encoded into a suitable format for transmission.

### **Types of Data Representation**

1. **Text**

   - Represented using character encoding schemes like:
     - **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** ‚Äì Uses 7 or 8 bits per character.
     - **Unicode** ‚Äì Supports multiple languages and symbols using 16, 32, or more bits.

2. **Numbers**

   - Stored in **binary (0s and 1s)** format for easy processing by computers.
   - Common representations:
     - Integer (whole numbers)
     - Floating-point (decimal numbers)

3. **Images**

   - Represented using **bitmaps (pixels) or vector graphics**.
   - Common formats:
     - **JPEG, PNG, GIF** ‚Äì Used for web and digital images.
     - **BMP, TIFF** ‚Äì Used for high-quality images.

4. **Audio**

   - Analog sound waves are converted into **digital signals** using techniques like **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**.
   - Common formats:
     - **MP3, WAV, AAC** ‚Äì Compressed and uncompressed formats for storing and streaming audio.

5. **Video**

   - Combination of **images and audio** in a sequence.
   - Video data is compressed using codecs like **H.264, MPEG, AVI, MP4** for efficient transmission and storage.

6. **Data Compression**
   - Reduces the size of data to optimize storage and transmission.
   - Two types:
     - **Lossless Compression** (e.g., ZIP, PNG) ‚Äì No data loss, original can be reconstructed.
     - **Lossy Compression** (e.g., MP3, JPEG) ‚Äì Some data is discarded to reduce file size.

## **Data Flow in Networking**

Data flow refers to the direction in which data travels between two communicating devices. It can be classified into three types: **Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex.**

### **1. Simplex Mode**

- Data flows in **one direction only** (unidirectional).
- The sender transmits, and the receiver only receives.
- Example:
  - **Radio broadcasting** (FM radio, TV broadcast).
  - **Keyboard to computer** (keyboard sends data, but does not receive).

üîπ **Advantage:** Simple and cost-effective.  
üîπ **Disadvantage:** No feedback or bidirectional communication.

### **2. Half-Duplex Mode**

- Data flows in **both directions**, but **only one direction at a time** (like a walkie-talkie).
- The sender and receiver take turns communicating.
- Example:
  - **Walkie-Talkies** (only one person can speak at a time).
  - **Shared Ethernet networks** (older systems).

üîπ **Advantage:** More efficient than simplex.  
üîπ **Disadvantage:** Slower than full-duplex since communication is not simultaneous.

### **3. Full-Duplex Mode**

- Data flows in **both directions simultaneously** (like a phone call).
- Both sender and receiver can communicate at the same time.
- Example:
  - **Telephone calls** (both people can talk at once).
  - **Modern Ethernet connections** (full-duplex switches allow simultaneous data transfer).

üîπ **Advantage:** Fast and efficient communication.  
üîπ **Disadvantage:** Requires more bandwidth and complex hardware.

### **Comparison Table**

| Mode            | Direction               | Simultaneous Communication | Example                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Simplex**     | One-way                 | ‚ùå No                      | TV Broadcast, Keyboard      |
| **Half-Duplex** | Two-way (one at a time) | ‚ùå No                      | Walkie-Talkie, Old Ethernet |
| **Full-Duplex** | Two-way (simultaneous)  | ‚úÖ Yes                     | Phone Call, Modern Ethernet |

   - Defines the format and structure of data.
   - Example: HTTP requests start with a method (e.g., GET, POST).

2. **Semantics (Meaning & Interpretation)**

   - Defines the meaning of each part of a message.
   - Example: An **HTTP 404** response means the page is not found.

3. **Timing (Synchronization & Speed)**
   - Ensures proper timing of data transmission.
   - Example: **Flow control** manages data transmission rates to avoid congestion.

### **Example: How HTTP Works**

1. A browser (client) sends an **HTTP GET request** to a web server.
2. The web server processes the request and sends an **HTTP response** with the requested webpage.
3. If secure, **HTTPS (TLS encryption)** protects the data from attackers.
