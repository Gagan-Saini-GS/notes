## **PSTN: Structure of the Telephone System**

The **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)** is the global network of telephone lines, fiber optics, satellites, and switching centers that allow voice communication between users. It is the foundation of traditional **landline telephony** and has evolved to support digital services like **DSL and ISDN**.

### **Structure of the Telephone System**

The PSTN is divided into different components that help in call routing and transmission:

#### **1. Subscriber (User) Section**

- The **end-users** who use telephones to make calls.
- Connected to the telephone exchange via a **local loop (twisted pair cables)**.

#### **2. Local Exchange (Central Office - CO)**

- A telephone switching facility that connects **local subscribers** within a small geographical area.
- It manages **dial tone, call routing, and call switching** for landline phones.

#### **3. Tandem Office (Intermediate Switching Center)**

- Connects multiple local exchanges **within a city or region**.
- Helps in **routing long-distance calls** efficiently.

#### **4. Toll Office (Long-Distance Switching Center)**

- Routes **long-distance calls** between cities or even countries.
- Uses **fiber optic cables, microwave links, or satellites** for communication.

#### **5. International Gateway**

- Connects national PSTN networks to the **global telephone network**.
- Uses **submarine cables, satellites, and high-speed fiber optics**.

### **PSTN Call Routing Example**

1. **Caller dials a number** (e.g., from New York to London).
2. The call is sent to the **Local Exchange (CO)**.
3. If it's a local call, it's connected immediately.
4. If it's a long-distance call, it goes through a **Tandem Office** and then to a **Toll Office**.
5. If it's an international call, it passes through the **International Gateway**.
6. The call reaches the recipientâ€™s **Local Exchange**, which connects to their phone.

### **PSTN Technologies**

ðŸ”¹ **Analog vs. Digital PSTN**

- **Older PSTN systems** used **analog signals** over twisted pair cables.
- **Modern PSTN systems** use **digital switching** for better call quality and efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ **Signaling in PSTN**

- **SS7 (Signaling System No. 7)** is the standard protocol used for call setup, routing, and disconnection.
- It supports services like **caller ID, call forwarding, and voicemail**.

ðŸ”¹ **Circuit-Switched Network**

- PSTN uses **circuit switching**, meaning a **dedicated path** is established for each call until it ends.
- This differs from **packet-switched networks** like the Internet, where data is split into packets and sent independently.

### **Comparison: PSTN vs. VoIP (Modern Telephony)**

| Feature          | PSTN (Traditional)                   | VoIP (Modern Internet Telephony)                |

## **Data Link Layer Design Issues**

The **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2 of the OSI model) is responsible for transferring data between devices on the same network and ensuring that data is delivered accurately and without errors. The design of this layer addresses key issues related to framing, error control, flow control, and how data is transmitted reliably over the network.

### **Key Design Issues of the Data Link Layer**

### **1. Framing**

Framing is the process of dividing the data received from the upper layers into manageable blocks called **frames** for transmission over the network. Each frame typically contains a **header**, **data payload**, and a **trailer**.

#### **Why Framing is Important:**

- **Delimits Data:** It marks the boundaries of a transmitted data unit so that the receiving device knows where the data begins and ends.
- **Error Detection:** The header and trailer often contain information used for **error checking**.
- **Synchronization:** Frames ensure that data is synchronized and can be transmitted at appropriate intervals.

#### **Frame Components:**

- **Header:** Contains control information (e.g., addresses, type of data).
- **Data Payload:** The actual user data being transmitted.
- **Trailer:** Typically contains error detection bits, like **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**, to ensure the integrity of the data.

### **2. Error Control**

Error control is an essential aspect of the Data Link Layer to ensure the reliable transmission of data. It involves detecting and correcting errors that may occur during the transmission of data over the network.

#### **Types of Errors:**

- **Single-bit errors:** Occur when a single bit is corrupted during transmission.
- **Burst errors:** Occur when a series of bits are corrupted in sequence.

#### **Error Detection Mechanisms:**

- **Parity Check:** Adds a single parity bit to the data to check whether the number of 1's is even or odd.
- **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):** A mathematical algorithm that generates a checksum value, which is compared between the sender and receiver to detect errors.
- **Checksum:** A value derived from a sum of the bits in the message, used to detect errors in data transmission.

#### **Error Correction Mechanisms:**

- **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ):** If an error is detected, the receiver can request the sender to retransmit the data.
  - **Stop-and-Wait ARQ:** The sender transmits one frame and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next one.
  - **Go-Back-N ARQ:** The sender can send multiple frames but the receiver will only acknowledge the last correctly received frame.
  - **Selective Repeat ARQ:** Only the frames that were received incorrectly are retransmitted.

### **3. Flow Control**

Flow control ensures that data is sent at an appropriate rate, preventing congestion or data loss. It is particularly important when the sender is faster than the receiver.

#### **Flow Control Mechanisms:**

- **Stop-and-Wait Protocol:** The sender waits for an acknowledgment after sending each frame before proceeding with the next one.
- **Sliding Window Protocol:** The sender can send multiple frames before receiving an acknowledgment. The receiver can manage the flow of data by sliding the window size, which controls the number of frames allowed in transit at once.
- **Credit-Based Flow Control:** This is a more complex method that provides a more efficient mechanism for managing the amount of data sent.

### **Protocols for Data Link Layer:**

#### **A. FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)**

FDDI is a high-speed networking standard used to connect devices over a **fiber-optic backbone**. It is commonly used for **LANs** and **backbone networks** due to its reliability and speed.

- **Speed:** Up to **100 Mbps**.
- **Topology:** It uses a **dual-ring topology** for fault tolerance, where data can flow in either direction around the network.

#### **B. CDDI (Copper Distributed Data Interface)**

CDDI is the copper-based counterpart to FDDI, providing similar functionality but using **twisted pair cables** instead of fiber optics.

- **Speed:** Also supports speeds up to **100 Mbps**.
- **Topology:** Uses a similar **dual-ring topology** like FDDI, providing **redundancy and fault tolerance**.

#### **C. Frame Relay**

Frame Relay is a **WAN protocol** used to connect devices in a **packet-switched network**. It provides **efficient data transfer** for bursty traffic and low-delay applications.

- **Speed:** Typically supports speeds ranging from **56 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps**.
- **Error Control:** It provides **error detection** but relies on higher layers for **error correction**.
- **Applications:** Commonly used for **connecting branch offices** in large organizations.

#### **D. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)**
