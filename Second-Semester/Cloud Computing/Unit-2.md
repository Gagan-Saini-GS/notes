## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Architecture**

### **1. What is Cloud Architecture?**

Cloud architecture is the design and structure of the various components required to build and deploy cloud computing systems.

It typically consists of:

- **Front-end platform:** The client devices and applications that users interact with (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps).
- **Back-end platform:** The servers, storage, databases, virtual machines, and services running in data centers.
- **Cloud-based delivery:** The network (Internet) connecting front-end and back-end.
- **Middleware:** Software that enables communication and management between front-end and back-end.

**Key goal:** To deliver scalable, flexible, and resilient cloud services efficiently.

### **2. Features of Cloud Architecture**

- **Scalability:** Automatically adjusts resources based on demand.
- **Elasticity:** Supports rapid provisioning and releasing of resources.
- **Multi-tenancy:** Supports multiple users sharing resources securely.
- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery.
- **Security:** Data encryption, authentication, access controls.
- **Resource Pooling:** Dynamic resource allocation across users.
- **Measured Service:** Usage monitoring and billing transparency.

### **3. Benefits of Cloud Architecture**

- **Cost Reduction:** Less upfront capital expense; pay for what you use.
- **High Availability:** Distributed architecture minimizes downtime.
- **Flexibility:** Access services anywhere, anytime.
- **Performance:** Efficient use of resources and load balancing.
- **Rapid Deployment:** Faster development and delivery of applications.
- **Simplified Management:** Centralized resource management.
