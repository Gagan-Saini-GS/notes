2. **Fake Headers**: Attackers modify the “From” field using software or custom scripts.
3. **Spoofed Domain Names**: Attackers may register lookalike domains (e.g., `micr0soft.com` instead of `microsoft.com`).

---

### 🧪 Example:

```plaintext
From: ceo@yourcompany.com
To: finance@yourcompany.com
Subject: Urgent payment

Please transfer ₹5,00,000 to this account by 5 PM.
```

The email looks legitimate but was spoofed by an attacker.

- It may appear small in scope but can have **large consequences**, especially in **finance, healthcare, or government data systems**.

---

## **10. Salami Attack**

### 🧂 What is a Salami Attack?

A **Salami Attack** involves **executing a series of small, usually unnoticeable actions**, that together result in a **large-scale fraud or impact**. It’s called “salami slicing” because like slicing a salami, each action takes a very thin slice — too small to be noticed individually.

---

### 🔍 Key Characteristics:

- The individual frauds are **too small to trigger alarms**.
- Attackers exploit **automated systems** (e.g., payroll, banking software).
- Often used to **divert fractions of funds repeatedly** into a separate account.
- Usually carried out by **insiders** with access to systems.

---

### 🧾 Common Examples:

1. **Banking Systems**:

   - Deducting ₹0.50 from every customer’s transaction and transferring it to the attacker’s account.

2. **Payroll Manipulation**:

   - Rounding up employee salaries and sending the extra paise to a dummy account.

3. **Telecom Billing**:

   - Adding small charges (₹1–2) in bills that customers often overlook.

---

### 🧠 Real-Life Case:

- A **programmer at a multinational bank** introduced code that diverted **paisa-roundoffs from thousands of transactions** into his own account. Over time, this accumulated to lakhs of rupees before detection.

---

### ⚖️ Legal Provisions:

- **Section 66** of ITA-2000 (hacking, data manipulation)
- **Section 43(c)** (unauthorized downloading/extracting of data)
- **IPC Section 420** (cheating and dishonesty)

**Punishment**: Up to 3 years imprisonment and/or fine up to ₹5 lakh or more.

---

### 🔐 Prevention Measures:

- **Audit Logs**: Record all minor and major changes or transactions.
- **Anomaly Detection Systems**: Detect abnormal patterns even in small data.
- **Code Reviews**: Regularly inspect source code in financial or billing applications.
- **Role Separation**: Don’t allow one person full access to code + financial systems.
- **Employee Monitoring**: Especially developers, accountants, or payroll managers.

---

### ✅ Summary:

- Salami Attacks involve **tiny, hidden manipulations** that can collectively lead to **massive financial losses**.
- They are hard to detect and require **robust monitoring and internal controls**.
