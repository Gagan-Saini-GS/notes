### ‚úÖ 1.1 Network Fundamentals

#### ‚û§ What is a Network?

A **computer network** is a group of interconnected devices that share resources and data. In forensic terms, it‚Äôs a potential source of **evidence** (packets, IP addresses, protocols, etc.).

#### ‚û§ Components of a Network (Forensic Relevance)

- **Nodes**: Devices (computers, routers, etc.)
- **Transmission Media**: Physical (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi)
- **Protocols**: Rules for communication (TCP/IP, FTP, HTTP, etc.)

#### ‚û§ Protocol Layers (OSI Model)

Forensics often focuses on **Layer 3 (Network)** and **Layer 4 (Transport)** to inspect:

- **IP addresses**
- **TCP/UDP traffic**
- **Packets**

| **Layer**    | **Function**            | **Forensic Relevance** |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Physical     | Bits transmission       | Not usually analyzed   |
| Data Link    | Frames, MAC             | Some evidence possible |
| Network      | IP addressing, routing  | IP, routing data       |
| Transport    | End-to-end connection   | TCP/UDP ports          |
| Session      | Session management      | Less common            |
| Presentation | Encryption, compression | Encryption forensics   |
| Application  | User-level interactions | Email, HTTP, DNS logs  |

| **NIDS (Network-based)** | Monitors entire network traffic | Best for detecting widespread threats |
| **HIDS (Host-based)**    | Monitors a single machine       | Detects insider or local attacks      |

#### üî∏ Advantages:

- Real-time threat detection
- Alerts based on known patterns (signature-based) or anomalies (behavior-based)
- Central logging for analysis
- Non-invasive: doesn‚Äôt block but monitors

#### üî∏ Disadvantages:

- False positives (benign events flagged)
- False negatives (missed threats)
- Cannot stop attack (only detect)
- High data volume can overwhelm system

---

### ‚úÖ 1.5 Forensic Importance of Network Logs

Logs are crucial in network forensics:

- **Firewall logs**: Inbound/outbound traffic
- **Web server logs**: Requests and IPs
- **Proxy logs**: Browsing history
- **IDS logs**: Alerts
- **Router logs**: Routing anomalies

These logs help **reconstruct the timeline of events** during an incident.

---

### ‚úÖ 1.6 Chain of Custody in Network Forensics

- **Collection**: Capture live traffic or logs.
- **Preservation**: Hash the logs, timestamp, use write-once media.
- **Analysis**: Use tools like Wireshark, NetWitness.
- **Presentation**: Provide clear reports in court-compatible formats.

Maintaining **chain of custody** ensures evidence integrity and legal acceptability.

| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**    | Used to send emails from client to server    | Can be intercepted or logged at sending stage           |
| **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)**           | Used to retrieve email (downloads to device) | Useful for local disk recovery                          |
| **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** | Used to access and manage email on server    | Emails stored on the server can be synced and recovered |

---

### ‚úÖ 2.2 Email as Evidence

Emails are legally accepted as **documentary evidence**, provided they meet **admissibility standards**.

#### üîπ Features as Evidence:

- **Sender & Receiver IDs**
- **Timestamp**
- **IP address of origin**
- **Message content and headers**
- **Attachments (can carry malware or images)**
- **Conversation threads**

#### üîπ Legal Requirements:

- Must be **authentic**
- **Unaltered** content
- Verified through **digital signatures, logs, headers**
- Collected with proper **chain of custody**

---

### ‚úÖ 2.3 Working of Email

1. **User composes email** using client (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).
2. The client **sends** it using **SMTP** to the mail server.
3. Server delivers it to **recipient‚Äôs server**.
4. Recipient accesses it using **POP3 or IMAP** via mail client.

---

### ‚úÖ 2.4 Steps in Email Communication (Flowchart Style)

```plaintext
[User Client]
     ‚Üì SMTP
[Sender Mail Server]
     ‚Üì Internet Routing
[Recipient Mail Server]
     ‚Üì IMAP/POP3
[Recipient Client]
```

Forensics involves **tapping or analyzing logs** at any of these stages.

---

### ‚úÖ 2.5 IP Tracking in Emails

#### üîπ Purpose:

Track down **location of sender**, detect **spoofing**, verify **header trail**.

#### üîπ Where is IP located?

- IPs are embedded in email headers like:

  ```
  Received: from [123.45.67.89] by mail.example.com
  ```

#### üîπ Tool Examples:

- **Email Header Analyzer**
- **MXToolbox**
- **TraceEmail**

Caution: In Gmail and other major clients, IPs may be masked due to privacy policies.

---

### ‚úÖ 2.6 Email Recovery Techniques

Even if deleted from inbox, emails often reside:

- In **local application files** (like Outlook‚Äôs `.PST`, `.OST`)
- In **web cache**, if accessed via browser
- In **server backups** (esp. corporate)
- In **recycle/trash folder** temporarily

#### üîπ Tools for Email Forensics:

# üé≠ 5. Steganography ‚Äì In-Depth

**Steganography** is the art and science of **hiding messages or data** inside other non-secret data (such as images, audio, text). In forensics, steganography is both a **challenge and investigative domain**.

---

### ‚úÖ 5.1 What is Steganography?

> Hiding data inside another file in such a way that the presence of hidden data is **not obvious**.

Unlike cryptography (which hides **content**), steganography hides the **existence** of the message itself.

---

### ‚úÖ 5.2 Categories of Steganography in Forensics

---

#### üìÑ 5.2.1 **Text Steganography**

- **Technique**: Hide messages in the formatting of text, spacing, font size, invisible characters, or between white spaces.
- **Examples**:

  - Using capital letters to represent binary.
  - Zero-width characters (Unicode).

- **Forensic Tools**: Stegdetect, custom Python scripts to decode patterns.

---

#### üñºÔ∏è 5.2.2 **Image Steganography**

- **Technique**: Embed data into image files (like `.jpg`, `.png`) using **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** insertion.
- **LSB Method**: Replaces the least significant bit of pixels with hidden data.

  - 1 pixel (RGB) = 3 bytes ‚Üí 3 bits usable for hiding

- **Detection**:

  - Image artifacts when zoomed
  - File size discrepancies
  - Statistical analysis (Chi-square tests)

- **Tools**:

  - **Steghide**
  - **OpenStego**
  - **zsteg**

---

#### üîä 5.2.3 **Audio Steganography**

- **Technique**: Embed data in audio files (.mp3, .wav) by modifying:

  - Least significant bits
  - Echo hiding
  - Spread spectrum

- **Challenges**: Audio compression (MP3) may destroy hidden data.
- **Tools**:

  - **DeepSound**
  - **MP3Stego**

- **Detection**:

  - Frequency analysis
  - File integrity comparison

---

### ‚úÖ 5.3 Importance of Steganography in Forensics

- **Cybercriminals use it to hide data** (malware, messages, exfiltrated files).
- **Digital forensics experts** must detect and extract such hidden content.
- Used in:

  - **Terrorism investigations**
  - **Corporate espionage**
  - **Data exfiltration cases**

---

### ‚úÖ 5.4 Anti-Steganography Techniques (Steganalysis)

| **Technique**            | **Function**                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Visual Inspection**    | Compare images/audio for differences   |
| **Statistical Analysis** | Histogram shifts in images             |
| **Signature Analysis**   | Search for stego tools‚Äô file markers   |
| **Noise Detection**      | Compare signal-to-noise ratio in media |
| **AI/ML Models**         | Classify media as stego/non-stego      |
