**Worm:**
Self-replicating malware that spreads without user interaction over networks.

**Trojan Horse (Trojan):**
Malicious software disguised as a legitimate application that opens backdoors for attackers.

**Differences:**

**Motivations:**

- Political activism
- Financial extortion
- Competitor sabotage

**Tools:**

- LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)
- HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon)

**Famous Examples:**

- GitHub DDoS attack (2018)
- Dyn DNS DDoS (2016) affecting Twitter, Netflix

**Impact:**

- Increased bandwidth costs

**Prevention:**

- Use of Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
- Traffic filtering and rate-limiting
- DDoS mitigation services (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai)

---

### 7. SQL Injection

**Definition:**
SQL Injection is a code injection technique used by attackers to manipulate SQL queries in web applications by inserting malicious SQL code into input fields.

**How it works:**
Attackers input SQL statements (like `' OR 1=1 --`) into a vulnerable form field, gaining unauthorized access to the database.

**Consequences:**

- Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Modification or deletion of database records
- Complete database takeover

**Prevention:**

- Use of prepared statements with parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Limiting database permissions
- Regular security testing and code audits

**Tools for Testing:**

- SQLMap
- Havij

### 8. Buffer Overflow

**Definition:**
A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a memory buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**How it's exploited:**
An attacker sends input larger than the buffer's capacity, causing it to overwrite function return addresses or control structures.

**Consequences:**

- Application crash
- Execution of malicious code
- Privilege escalation

**Prevention:**

- Use of memory-safe languages (e.g., Java, Python)
- Bounds checking
- Stack canaries
- Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP)

---

### 9. Attacks on Wireless Networks

**Definition:**
Wireless networks transmit data via radio frequencies, which makes them susceptible to interception and unauthorized access. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi protocols to compromise data.

**Types of Attacks:**

- **Eavesdropping:** Intercepting data packets.
- **Rogue Access Points:** Unauthorized Wi-Fi points used to mimic legitimate networks.
- **Evil Twin Attack:** Duplicating a legitimate network to trick users into connecting.
- **WEP/WPA Cracking:** Exploiting weak encryption in older Wi-Fi protocols.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** Intercepting communications between two devices.

**Consequences:**

- Data theft
- Unauthorized network access
- Malware injection

**Prevention:**

- Use WPA3 or at least WPA2 encryption.
- Hide SSID (network name) broadcasting.
- Employ MAC address filtering.
- Use strong Wi-Fi passwords.
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies.

### 10. Identity Theft (ID Theft)

**Definition:**
Identity theft is the act of stealing someone’s personal information (name, address, Aadhaar/PAN, bank details) to commit fraud, such as opening accounts or making purchases in the victim’s name.

**Types:**

- **Financial Identity Theft:** Using stolen credentials to access financial accounts.
- **Criminal Identity Theft:** Impersonating someone else to avoid legal consequences.
- **Medical Identity Theft:** Using another person's data for medical services.

**Methods Used by Cybercriminals:**

- Phishing emails and fake websites
- Data breaches and leaks
- Social engineering and phone scams
- Skimming devices on ATMs

**Consequences:**

- Loss of money and credit score damage
- Legal issues for the victim
- Long-term reputation damage

**Prevention:**

- Monitor credit reports regularly
- Use identity theft protection tools
- Do not share sensitive data over insecure channels
- Use strong, unique passwords and MFA

### 11. Proxies and Anonymizers

**Definition:**
Proxies and anonymizers are tools used to mask the original IP address of a user, providing anonymity and hiding their location and identity during internet communication.

**Types:**

- **Proxy Servers:** Intermediaries between the user and the internet that forward requests.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks):** Encrypt and tunnel user data through remote servers.
- **Tor Network:** Routes traffic through multiple volunteer nodes to anonymize the source.

**Uses in Cybercrime:**

- Concealing attacker identity and location.
- Bypassing geo-restrictions or firewalls.
- Evading IP-based bans or blacklists.
- Facilitating illegal activities such as hacking, phishing, or accessing dark web markets.

**Risks:**

- Some free proxies/loggers may collect user data.
- Use of anonymizers complicates investigation and attribution.

**Prevention:**

- Use IP reputation services to detect suspicious proxy usage.
- Implement multi-layered network security monitoring.

### 12. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

**Definition:**
APTs are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks where an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period to steal data or sabotage systems.

**Characteristics:**

- Highly sophisticated and well-funded attackers.
- Use multiple attack vectors (spear phishing, zero-day exploits).
