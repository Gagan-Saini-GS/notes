- A technique where cybercriminals impersonate legitimate organizations via email, SMS, or fake websites to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers.
- **Example**: A user receives an email claiming to be from a bank, asking them to log in to verify account details on a fake site.
- **Indian IT Act**:

  - **Section 66C**: Identity theft.
  - **Section 66D**: Cheating by personation using computer resources.

### 2. Password Cracking

- The process of recovering passwords from data stored or transmitted.
- **Types**:

  - Brute Force Attack: Tries all combinations.
  - Dictionary Attack: Uses common words.
  - Rainbow Tables: Uses precomputed hashes.

- **Defense**: Strong passwords, password managers, account lockout policies.

### 3. Keyloggers and Spywares

- **Keyloggers**: Software or hardware that records every keystroke.
- **Spyware**: Software that secretly monitors user activity.
- Used to steal login data, credit card numbers, and confidential info.
- **Indian IT Act**:

  - Covered under **Section 43** (unauthorized access) and **Section 66** (data theft).

### 4. Virus, Worms, and Trojans

- **Virus**: Attaches to files and spreads when the file is executed.
- **Worm**: Spreads independently through networks.
- **Trojan**: Disguises as legitimate software but performs malicious actions.
- Effects: System crashes, data loss, remote access.

### 5. Steganography

- Technique of hiding secret data within ordinary files like images, audio, or video.
- Used to covertly transmit malicious data or instructions.
- Difficult to detect without special tools.

---

### 6. DoS and DDoS Attacks

### 7. SQL Injection

- A code injection technique that inserts malicious SQL commands into input fields to access or manipulate a database.
- Can bypass authentication, access user data, or delete records.
- **Prevention**: Input validation, parameterized queries.

---

### 8. Buffer Overflow

- Occurs when more data is written to a memory buffer than it can hold.
- Exploited to execute arbitrary code, cause crashes, or take control of systems.
- Prevented using secure coding practices.

---

### 9. Attacks on Wireless Networks

- Target wireless communication to steal data or disrupt service.
- **Methods**:

  - Eavesdropping
  - Rogue Access Points
  - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks

- **Protection**: WPA3/WPA2 encryption, VPNs, MAC filtering.

---

### 10. Identity Theft (ID Theft)
