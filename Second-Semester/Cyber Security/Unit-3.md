# Introduction to Digital Forensics â€“ Detailed In-Depth Notes

### 1. Introduction to Digital Forensics and Its Uses

**Definition:**
Digital Forensics (also known as Computer Forensics) is a branch of forensic science that focuses on the recovery, investigation, and analysis of material found in digital devices, often in relation to cybercrimes or unauthorized activities. The goal is to uncover and preserve digital evidence in a way that is legally admissible in courts.

**Uses and Applications:**

- **Criminal Investigations:** Tracking cybercriminals in cases like hacking, fraud, and identity theft.
- **Corporate Investigations:** Detecting insider threats, intellectual property theft, and policy violations.
- **Incident Response:** Understanding how breaches or attacks occurred and limiting further damage.
- **Data Recovery:** Retrieving deleted or encrypted files that can serve as evidence.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meeting legal and industry standards for data protection and audit trails.
- **Litigation Support:** Providing evidence and expert testimony during legal disputes involving digital evidence.

**Examples:**

- Recovering deleted emails to prove fraud.
- Tracking the origin of malware attacks on a network.
- Extracting data from seized smartphones in criminal cases.

### 2. Need for Digital Forensics

**Why Digital Forensics is Essential:**

- **Evidence Integrity:** Digital evidence is fragile and easily altered; forensic methods ensure the original data is preserved.
- **Legal Admissibility:** Courts require strict adherence to forensic protocols for evidence to be accepted.
- **Timely Incident Response:** Quick forensic analysis helps organizations respond and remediate breaches efficiently.
- **Attribution:** Identifying the responsible person(s) behind an attack or breach.
- **Prevention of Future Attacks:** Forensic insights lead to improved security posture.
- **Accountability and Transparency:** Ensures employees or external actors are held responsible for malicious acts.

**Challenges Without Forensics:**

- Evidence may be lost or corrupted.
- Misattribution could occur.
- Legal cases might be dismissed due to improper evidence handling.

### 3. Digital Forensic Life Cycle

The forensic process consists of several critical phases, each requiring strict control:

| Phase              | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identification** | Detecting and identifying potential sources of digital evidence (computers, servers, phones).  |
| **Preservation**   | Securing and isolating digital devices to prevent alteration, damage, or contamination.        |
| **Collection**     | Acquiring data using forensic tools ensuring no change to the original evidence.               |
| **Examination**    | Processing the collected data to find relevant information like logs, files, metadata.         |
| **Analysis**       | Interpreting the examined data to reconstruct events, detect patterns, and draw conclusions.   |
| **Presentation**   | Documenting and presenting findings clearly, often including expert testimony in courts.       |
| **Decision**       | Based on forensic results, decisions for prosecution, remediation, or policy changes are made. |

**Chain of Custody:**
Maintaining a documented history of evidence handling to ensure it remains untampered and admissible.

**Important Notes:**

- All phases must be repeatable and verifiable.
- Use of write blockers during data acquisition to avoid data alteration.
- Metadata analysis is key to establishing timelines.

### 4. Relevance of the OSI 7 Layer Model to Computer Forensics

Understanding the OSI Model is crucial in forensic network investigations because it helps to isolate and analyze network communication at different abstraction levels.

| OSI Layer                 | Role in Network Communication                          | Forensic Relevance                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layer 1: Physical**     | Transmission of raw bits over cables, wireless signals | Examining physical evidence like network cables, NICs, devices.      |
| **Layer 2: Data Link**    | Data frames, MAC addressing, error detection           | Investigate MAC addresses, ARP spoofing, VLAN hopping.               |
| **Layer 3: Network**      | IP addressing, routing, packet forwarding              | Analyzing IP packets, VPN logs, routing anomalies.                   |
| **Layer 4: Transport**    | TCP/UDP, session establishment, port management        | Investigate session states, port scanning, connection attempts.      |
| **Layer 5: Session**      | Managing sessions, dialogs between applications        | Analyze SSL/TLS sessions, authentication protocols.                  |
| **Layer 6: Presentation** | Data encryption, compression, formatting               | Decode encrypted payloads, data transformation analysis.             |
| **Layer 7: Application**  | End-user applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS)           | Analyze web logs, email headers, DNS queries for malicious activity. |

**Use in Forensics:**

- Helps correlate logs from different devices (routers, firewalls, servers).
- Assists in reconstructing the path and method of an attack.
- Identifies which protocol or layer was exploited.

### 5. Forensics and Social Networking Sites: Security/Privacy Threats

Social networking sites are increasingly involved in forensic investigations due to:

**Security/Privacy Threats:**

- **Fake Profiles & Impersonation:** Used for social engineering or spreading misinformation.
- **Phishing & Malware Distribution:** Links on social media can lead to malware downloads.
- **Data Mining & Scraping:** Personal info harvested and misused.
- **Cyberbullying & Harassment:** Leading to emotional and legal issues.
- **Unauthorized Data Sharing:** Privacy violations due to loose platform policies.

**Forensic Challenges on Social Media:**

- Rapidly changing content and deleted posts make data volatile.
- Privacy settings restrict access to forensic investigators.
- Data distributed across global servers complicate jurisdiction.
- Encryption (e.g., private chats) limits visibility.

**Investigative Uses:**

- Tracking suspects through timeline analysis.
- Extracting metadata from photos or videos.
- Analyzing communication patterns and social graphs.
- Recovering deleted content using APIs or third-party tools.
